# The HTML Audit Handbook

**Auditing, Optimizing and Reviewing Web Markup to Modern Standards**

The **HTML Audit Handbook** is a technical document designed to **review, audit, and optimize HTML codebases** according to the latest specifications, performance best practices, and accessibility standards.

This is **not** a beginner's HTML tutorial.  
Instead, it is a **reference and audit framework** for developers, consultants, and technical leads who want to ensure that HTML is:

- **Semantically correct**
- **Accessible**
- **Performance-oriented**
- **Standards-compliant**

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose
HTML is the foundation of the web, but most production HTML suffers from:
- Misused or missing semantic elements
- Accessibility gaps
- Bloated, unoptimized markup
- Compatibility issues across browsers

The goal of this handbook is to provide:
- A **clear checklist** for HTML audits
- Examples of **correct vs. incorrect patterns**
- **Cross-references** to MDN, web.dev, and WHATWG specifications
- Guidance for **performance and SEO** improvements

## ðŸ“š Methodology
- Based entirely on **official specifications** and documentation (WHATWG, W3C, MDN, Google web.dev)
- **Practical examples** for each concept
- Focus on **real-world HTML code audits**
- Includes **audit checklists** for quick reviews
- Updated regularly as web standards evolve

## ðŸ“‚ Structure
1. **Fundamentals & Semantics** â€“ Understanding ideal HTML structure
2. **Common Patterns & Pitfalls** â€“ Before/after examples
3. **Specification Cross-References** â€“ What the standard says
4. **Audit Checklist** â€“ Fast review of any HTML document
5. **Optimization** â€“ Accessibility, performance, SEO

## ðŸ›  Usage

- Audit client websites
- Perform code reviews
- Train teams on HTML best practices
- Self-check your own projects before deployment

## ðŸ“„ Format
- **Single HTML document** with internal table of contents
